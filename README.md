# advent-of-code-2022
A little attempt at advent of code in Feb.

(Just trying to keep my Java skills up whilst I am doing front end stuff at work)

Run using Intellij's built in run function (if you're using another IDE or editor you're on your own buddy)

_Might use this for learning a new skill when I have finished the advent - e.g. I've been meaning to learn gradle for ages_
